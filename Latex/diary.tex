\section{11 / 1 / 2021}
    I found a bug in bluespec reference guide
    \hyperlink{https://github.com/BSVLang/Main/blob/master/Language_Spec/bsv-reference-guide.pdf}{Official pdf}
    On page 30 method proto has $([ methodProtoFormals ])$ 
    and it should have $[( methodProtoFormals)]$ 
    otherwise you can't declare method without any round brackets like it's done in IntStack example bellow
    as theirs nontaion assume $[]$ as zero or more. 

    \subsection{Lark grammar}
         I implemented grammar for parsing interfaces declatations written in bluespec (without support for subinteraces)
         and parsing for Interfaces results of command Bluetcl type full \( Name of interface \)

\section{12/ 1 / 2021}
    I added grammar for parsing functions creating modules this way one can 
    read what modules can be created how they need to be initiazlied and what interfaces they have.  

\section{13 / 1 / 2021}
    I added more text to main.tex about toolchains and a more detailed plan for structure of the library. I also added a openALL.bat file, that is for me to make opening useful pdfs easier.
