1. Typeclasses, check if it's and istance of typeclass:
    Typeclasses of intrest: Connectable(get and put), ToSink, ToSource, toget, ToPut

2. Routing , Routable has a routable field and we get it via routingField(duck)

3. Rounting maps to function -> oneHot vector of size of number of slaves


-----------------------------

1. Selecting sub interface for source / sink 

2. Create bus , Selecting type of bus ( detect if we are axi4 then do special function)

3. 


Generated function should use size from number of connected components done
Formalize AFlit done 
Add test with AFlit done


Do mkConnection via connectable  done

Questrions: maybe replicate typedefs indead of querring
